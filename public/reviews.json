        "says": "For all the hobbyists this is probably a great drone. I'm not a hobbyist and purchased this to take aerial photos of homes that I sell and probably would never operate it higher than about 75-100'. Unfortunately, what isn't mentioned here is that this product has many restrictions called geo zones which render this drone useless in quite a few areas.",

The things that are notable are Ocusync 2, 4K video, big increase in wind resistance, and quick shots. As well as longer flight time and stronger propellor motors.",

It is easy to fly--I even took it out over water on my first flight, although briefly and controlled in Cine mode. Despite the small, compact size, it is surprisingly stable and takes sharp images, even in some wind.",

        "says": "Significant upgrades across the board when compared to the Mini 1. The main one is definitely Ocusync 2.0, which is a tremendous improvement from the Wifi system utilized in the Mini 1. Everything else was bumped up a bit as well: 4k camera, improved top speed, implementation of RAW image format. It's basically what the Mini 1 should have been.",

        "says": "This is my first impression, having just received the drone, opened it up am busy charging everything up. It is a really well built product. But the company really misses out in the area of the phone/tablet mount and cables. For a drone of this quality one would expect that users may want to use a small tablet but my 9 inch tablet is just a bit to big and the cables are to short, so I have to purchase a tablet holder and cables, $40 more.",
